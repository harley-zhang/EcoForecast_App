## Overview

[EcoForecast](https://ecoforecast.info/) is a web application that allows users to visualize and analyze future ecological changes in the sagebrush habitat across the United States. The app utilizes data generated by the [STEPWAT2 simulation model](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2) and is built using Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript API for geospatial analysis and remote sensing. EcoForecast is a public Earth Engine App.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset:** The app is powered by a comprehensive dataset covering the entire sagebrush habitat in the United States for various climate, plant, soil, and water parameters over the next century.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** EcoForecast provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily visualize and analyze ecological changes in their area of interest with just a few clicks.

- **Parameter Selection:** Users can customize their analysis by selecting relevant parameters such as functional plant group, time period, wildfire levels, and representative concentration pathway (climate scenarios based on greenhouse gas trajectories).

- **Map Visualization:** The selected data is displayed on an interactive map, making it easy for users to interpret and analyze ecological changes over time.
