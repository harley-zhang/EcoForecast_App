## Overview

[EcoForecast](https://ecoforecast.info/) is a web application that allows users to visualize and analyze future ecological changes in the sagebrush habitat across the United States. The app utilizes data generated using the [STEPWAT2 simulation model](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2) and is built using [Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) for geospatial analysis and remote sensing. 

To clone this repository:

## Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset:** The app is powered by a comprehensive dataset covering the entire sagebrush habitat in the United States for various climate, plant, soil, and water parameters over the next century.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** EcoForecast provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily visualize and analyze ecological changes in their area of interest with just a few clicks.

- **Parameter Selection:** Users can customize their analysis by selecting relevant parameters such as functional plant group, time period, wildfire levels, and representative concentration pathway (climate scenarios based on greenhouse gas trajectories).

- **Map Visualization:** The selected data is displayed on an interactive map, making it easy for users to interpret and analyze ecological changes over time.

## Currently working on...

- **Info sections:** Allows user to open and close a small, light explanation tab for different parameters.

- **Guided app tour:** A feature that takes first-time users on a (skippable) guided tour of the apps features.

- **Contextual website:** A website centered around the app that provides additional info on STEPWAT2, the app functionality, updates, and significant findings in related fields.

- **UI updates:** Improving UI elements like animations, logos, fonts, color schemes, etc.
