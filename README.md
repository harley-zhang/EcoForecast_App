# EcoForecast App

## Overview

EcoForecast is a web application that allows users to visualize and analyze future ecological changes in the sagebrush habitat across the United States. The app utilizes data generated by the STEPWAT2 simulation model and is built on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript API for geospatial analysis and remote sensing.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset:** The app is powered by a comprehensive dataset covering the entire sagebrush habitat in the United States for various climate, plant, soil, and water parameters over the next century.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** EcoForecast provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily visualize and analyze ecological changes in their area of interest with just a few clicks.

- **Parameter Selection:** Users can customize their analysis by selecting relevant parameters such as functional plant group, time period, wildfire levels, and representative concentration pathway (climate scenarios based on greenhouse gas trajectories).

- **Map Visualization:** The selected data is displayed on an interactive map, making it easy for users to interpret and analyze ecological changes over time.
